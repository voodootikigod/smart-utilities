A script that you can put into your path (/usr/local/bin or ~/bin) that will automatically create the necessary directory structure for you. It will also add GitHub and Joyent repositories if you add the third parameter which is the username. If your GitHub and Joyent usernames are different, add a fourth parameter. Usage:

smart project_name _githubusername_ _joyentusername_
